# Wikipedia clone
This project is a Wikipedia's page clone built in django.
- Home page: Lists all the articles saved.
- Create new page: Allows the user to create a new article by filling out a form.
- Random page: Bring a random article.
- Search field: If a searched word matches an article title, it redirects to that page; otherwise, a page with possible results is shown. For example, if the searched word is "ytho", then Python should appear in the search results.
- Edit Button: On each article page, there is an edit button. When clicked, the user will be redirected to a form that contains the actual content of the article to be edited.
